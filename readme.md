# Online Course NFTs

## 1. Project Title
**Online Course NFTs**

## 2. Project Description
This Clarity smart contract creates **Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)** representing access to online courses. Each NFT acts as a proof-of-ownership, granting exclusive access to premium content. The contract also introduces a **basic staking mechanism** where NFT holders can stake their course NFTs to earn benefits (such as bonus content, certification perks, or community rewards).

## 3. Project Vision
The vision is to integrate blockchain-powered NFTs with the e-learning industry, allowing course providers to tokenize access rights, enhance security, and provide additional engagement through staking. This ensures verifiable ownership and fosters a community of learners who can benefit from holding and staking course NFTs.

## 4. Future Scope
- **Dynamic Rewards**: Allow staked NFTs to earn platform tokens.
- **Course Access Control**: Automatically grant platform access based on NFT ownership.
- **Secondary Marketplace**: Enable secure transfer/resale of course NFTs.
- **Multi-Course Bundles**: Mint NFTs representing bundles of multiple courses.
- **On-Chain Certificates**: Award blockchain-based completion certificates to NFT owners.
